The Monty language

Monty bytecode is a representation of Monty scripting language instructions in a compact form that is meant to be executed by a virtual machine. When a Monty script is written, it's first compiled into Monty bytecode before execution. This bytecode contains a series of instructions that the Monty interpreter can understand and execute.
